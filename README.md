# Project_SE_Salary-Prediction
Use Logistic Regression to construct the model and do the PCA .
This project focuses on predicting and classifying income levels across the Southeast Asian region based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning, the analysis identifies key drivers of income disparity and provides a predictive framework for salary categorization.

📊 Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized distribution, correlations, and identified outliers.

2. Data Preprocessing: Implemented One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and Standard Scaling for numerical features.

3. Dimensionality Reduction: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature redundancy while retaining maximum variance.

4. Modeling: Trained and tuned a Logistic Regression classifier.

5. Evaluation: Assessed performance using a Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall curves, and F1-Score.
